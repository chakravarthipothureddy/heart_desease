# ðŸš€ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, but early detection can save lives.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This end-to-end machine learning project analyzes clinical and lifestyle parameters to predict the likelihood of heart disease. By leveraging patient health data, the model helps identify high-risk individuals, enabling timely medical intervention.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
### Data Processing: 
Cleaned and analyzed datasets with missing value imputation, Droping Duplicate Values, outlier handling, and feature scaling.

### Model Development: 
Trained and evaluated multiple algorithms (KNN, SVM, Random Forest), with Random Forest achieving 85% accuracy.

### Web Deployment: 
Built an interactive Flask-based web app for real-time predictions, hosted on Render.
